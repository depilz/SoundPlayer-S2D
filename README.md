MUSIC & SOUND PLAYERS FOR SOLAR2D
</h1>

## Description
In the effort of making the sound control in Solar2D more enjoyable, I have created the SoundPlayer and the MusicPlayer libraries that I'm sharing in this project.

I have separated both in 2 different files (Music and sfx) so it is easier to understand and handle, and you can use each one separately, just respecting the 2 reserved channels for the MusicPlayer.

## SETUP

You need to copy the `tween` and `device` lua files in the same folder as the `soundPlayer` and the `musicPlayer`.

By default the audio folder is `Assets/Audio`, but you can change this by setting the `folder` attribute in both the sound and music players.
```lua
SoundPlayer.folder = "assets/audio/sfx/"
MusicPlayer.folder = "assets/audio/music/"
```

The default extensions are `.ogg` for android and `.aac` for evertying else. You can change this by setting the `defExt` attribute in both libraries.
```lua
SoundPlayer.defExt = ".mp3"
MusicPlayer.defExt = ".mp3"
```

## NOTES

* It uses the [audio](https://docs.coronalabs.com/api/library/audio/index.html) library in the core.

* The volume increases logaritmically which makes more sense for our ears.

* It also uses the [transition](https://docs.coronalabs.com/api/library/transition/to.html) library to fade the tracks, so be careful using `transition.pause()`, `transition.resume()`, and `transition.cancel()`.

* All sounds and images in this project are taken from the Internet and work under their own licenses.

# MusicPlayer
Designed to play music tracks and provide useful tools for it, the MusicPlayer reserves the first 2 audio channels for this purpose.

## Methods

* ### load(track [, ext])
  * Loads a track located in the audio folder. The track is the actual name of the file and the extension is optional, if not provided it uses `.ogg` for Android and `.aac` for iOS.
     ```lua
     MusicPlayer.load("my song", ".wav")
     ```

* ### play(track [, params])
  * Plays some of the loaded tracks. The `track` is the same used before on `load()`.
  * You can also send some parameters containing the following entries:
    * **loops**: How many times it is going to play/repeat until completion. (default is -1)
    * **ext**: If the track has not been loaded yet, this method will also try to load it, so specifying the extension could be useful in such case.
    * **onComplete**: Listener for the audio succesful completion.
    * **onCancel**: Listener for the audio playing cancellation.
     ```lua
     MusicPlayer.play("my song", {
       loops      = 3,
       onComplete = playNextSong,
       onCancel   = printSomething,
     })
     ```

* ### fade(track [, params])
  * This method fades-out the current playing track and fades-in the one provided. It could also be used to simply fade-in a track when no music is being played at the moment.
The params are the same as in the `play` method with the only difference that this could also contain the `time` entry.
    * **time:** The time it takes to fade the tracks. default is 700 (ms).
     ```lua
     MusicPlayer.fade("my song", {
       time       = 2000,
       loops      = 3,
     })
     ```

* ### fadeOut(time)
  * Fades out the entire music, so it works normally even if it is currently fading 2 tracks.

* ### getDuration(sound)
  * Returns the durations of a **loaded** track. It doesn't work to get the duration of a full sequence.

* ### isPlaying()
  * Returs true if a music is being played.

* ### setVolume(v)
  * Sets the master volume of the music. It does not interfere with any fading action.

* ### resume()
  * Resumes playing.

* ### pause()
  * Pauses the music.

* ### stop()
  * Completely stops playing a music or a sequence.



# MusicPlayer sequences
Still part of the MusicPlayer library, the music sequences are useful when you have a set of tracks that need to be played one after the other, eiher if the structure is something like:`intro` -> `loop for ever`.

Or if you want to increase the tension in a battle by leveling up (by command) the strenght of the song.
  `starts slow` -> `battle started` -> `boss phase 2` -> `boss phase 3` -> `track ends`

 The sequence is an array with the necessary data to play each track.
The node could be either a string or a table:
* **String:** Just plays the specified track.
* **Table:** Containing the `track`, the `loops`, and the `fadeTime` in that order. Only the `track` is mandatory, `loops` is -1 by default and fadeTime is `nil`.
    ```lua
    local sequence1 = {track1, track2, {track3, nil, 800}}
    local sequence2 = {{track1, 1}, {track2, 1}, {track3, 1}}
    ```

Now, the following methods are useful to handle these sequences:

## Methods
* ### playSequence(sequence [, onComplete])
  * Plays a sequence of tracks that could be played one after the other or controlled by the method `playNext`.
  * The onComplete function is optional and is going to be called when the last track ends. (Also works when `PlayNext` is called to end a sequence)
     ```lua
     local sequence = {track1, track2, {track3, nil, 800}}
     MusicPlayer.playSequence(sequence, showGameOver)
     ```

* ### fadeSequence(sequence [, time] [, onComplete])
  * Fades the sequence provided with the current track or simply fades-in if not existent. `time` is the time it takes to fade and `onComplete` is the same as for `playSequence`.
     ```lua
     local sequence = {track1, track2, {track3, nil, 800}}
     MusicPlayer.fadeSequence(sequence, showGameOver)
     ```

* ### playNext()
  * It plays the next track in a sequence. Returns the name of the track and `nil` if the sequence has ended or has never been started.

* ### loadSequences(data)
  * You can predefine a set of sequences so you can play them later simply by passing a string.
     ```lua
     local sequences = {
       sequence1 = {track1, track2, {track3, nil, 800}}
       sequence2 = {{track1, 1}, {track2, 1}, {track3, 1}}
     }

     MusicPlayer.loadSequences(sequences)

     MusicPlayer.playSequence("sequence1")
     ```


  > _**NOTE:**_ This is not going to load the tracks, you have to do that manually with `MusicPlayer.load()`.



# SoundPlayer

Specifically designed to play sound effects, but could also be used to play enviromental sounds, such as wind or crickets.

## Methods
* ### load(sound [, ext] [, useMediaForAndroid])
  * Pre-loads a sound. The extension works the same as in the MusicPlayer and `useMediaForAndroid` is a flag used if you **NEED** a sound to be loaded and played using the `media` library instead of `audio`, this <I>could</I> be useful if a sound is not being played instantly on Android, but `media` does't have a volume control so it just plays or not depending of the SoundPlayer volume.
     ```lua
     SoundPlayer.load("mySfx", ".mp3")
     ```

* ### play(sound [, params])
  * Plays a sound. The optional parameters are:
    * **loops:** The number of times you want the audio to loop
    * **duration:** This will cause the system to play the audio for the specified amount of time and then auto-stop the playback regardless of whether the audio has finished or not.
    * **ext: Specify** the extension in case the sound has not been loaded yet.
    * **onComplete:** Listener for the audio succesful completion.
    * **onCancel:** Listener for the audio playing cancellation.
     ```lua
     SoundPlayer.play("mySfx", {loops = 2})
     ```

* ### getDuration(sound)
  * Returns the duration of a **loaded** sound.

* ### setVolume(v)
  * Sets the sounds master volume.

* ### mute()
  * Sets master volume to 0.

* ### resume()
  * Resume playing all sounds.

* ### pause()
  * Pause all current sounds.

* ### stop()
  * Completly stops playing all sounds.
